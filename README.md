# Terraform Examples

This repository serves as a collection of Terraform examples for various infrastructure provisioning scenarios. Each example provides a practical demonstration of how to use Terraform to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure resources.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments using a declarative configuration language.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a software engineering practice that enables the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources through machine-readable configuration files. By treating infrastructure as code, you can version, automate, and collaborate on infrastructure changes, leading to more reliable and scalable deployments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-examples.git`
2. Navigate to the desired example directory: `cd terraform-examples/example-name`
3. Initialize the Terraform configuration: `terraform init`
4. Modify the variables and resources in the example to suit your requirements.
5. Provision the infrastructure: `terraform apply`

Please refer to the individual example directories for more detailed instructions and explanations.
